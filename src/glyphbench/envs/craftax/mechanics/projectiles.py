"""Projectile entity and container for Phase α.

Projectiles are persistent tile entities that travel one step per turn
along (dx, dy) and are removed when they hit a solid block, a target,
or leave the map. Damage is scalar in Phase α; Phase γ T12γ adds the
optional damage_vec 3-tuple for elemental (physical, fire, ice) damage.
If damage_vec is None, scalar damage is treated as pure physical.
