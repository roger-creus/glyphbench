"""Phase-β dungeon-room biome generator (T18β).

Generates a dungeon floor with multiple non-overlapping rectangular rooms
connected by L-shaped corridors.  Returns the grid plus metadata positions
for chests, fountains, stairs, and the agent spawn.

The generator is pure Python (no env state) so it can be unit-tested
independently.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    1. Place *num_rooms* non-overlapping rooms (width/height 5-10 each) by
       rejection sampling up to 200 attempts per room.  If fewer than 2 rooms
       are placed, fall back to two guaranteed rooms so the floor is always
       playable.
    2. Connect adjacent rooms with L-shaped corridors (horizontal then vertical).
    3. Place 1 ``TILE_CHEST`` per room at a random interior position
       (if *with_chests*).
    4. With 50% probability per room place 1 ``TILE_FOUNTAIN`` at a different
       interior position (if *with_fountains*).
    5. Place ``TILE_STAIRS_UP`` in the first room, ``TILE_STAIRS_DOWN`` in the
       last room.
    6. Agent spawn is a safe interior tile in the first room (near stairs-up).
