    """Mini Kangaroo: 12x14 tower with 3 floors and a hazard.

    The tower has 4 floors (rows 12, 9, 6, 3). Floor 0 is start (row 12),
    Floor 1 (row 9), Floor 2 (row 6), Floor 3 (row 3, top = goal).
    Each floor pair has TWO ladder columns (so random play is less likely
    to wedge: even from a cul-de-sac the player can find a ladder by
    walking either way). Floor 0->1 ladders at cols 1 and 10; floor 1->2
    ladders at cols 4 and 10; floor 2->3 ladders at cols 1 and 7.
    Reaching a higher floor for the first time gives +1/3. A coconut
    hazard (o) drops every 4 ticks from row 0 in a column chosen each
    drop; if it lands on the player's cell, -1 terminal. Hazards
    disappear when they hit a floor.
