"""miniatari Chopper Command.

Identity: Helicopter shooter; destroy enemy helis while protecting the
truck convoy on the ground.
Win condition: destroy all 5 enemy helicopters with at least one truck
still alive.
Reward: Pattern A, +1/5 per enemy destroyed; Pattern D, terminal -1 if
every truck is destroyed (convoy lost).
Loss: collision with an enemy helicopter ends the run (no -1, just
terminates); all trucks destroyed -> -1 terminal.

    """Mini Chopper Command: 16x10 grid, 5 enemy helis above a 3-truck convoy.

    Player heli (Y) starts mid-left. Enemy helis (E) drift horizontally on
    rows 2..6, bouncing off side walls. 3 trucks (T) sit stationary on the
    ground row (y=8). Each tick the player can move LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN by
    1 cell or FIRE a bullet in their last horizontal facing direction. The
    bullet travels up to 6 cells in its direction that same tick,
    destroying the first enemy in line. Enemies drift one cell every 2
    ticks; an enemy that is directly above a truck has a small chance to
    dive once per tick and obliterate that truck. Colliding with an enemy
    ends the run with no further reward. Lose if every truck is destroyed
    (-1 terminal). Win by destroying all 5 enemies while at least one
    truck is still alive (+1/5 per kill, Pattern A).
