    """Mini River Raid: 12-wide river that scrolls upward; 8 obstacles.

    The world is 12 wide x 16 tall, with banks at columns 0-1 and 10-11
    (visible walls █). The player jet (Y) sits at row 14 and moves
    LEFT/RIGHT (1 cell each). Obstacles (T) are at scattered positions
    along the river; the world scrolls up 1 row every 2 ticks (player's
    position fixed; obstacles drift down toward the player). FIRE shoots
    a missile straight up the player's column, destroying the closest
    obstacle there if any. Each cleared (shot) or passed (drifted past
    player row) obstacle counts as +1/9 progress. After all 8 obstacles
    are dealt with AND 50 ticks have elapsed, the river ends — final
    +1/9 (win). Collision with an obstacle (it reaches the player's
    cell) is -1 terminal.
