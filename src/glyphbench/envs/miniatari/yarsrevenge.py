"""miniatari Yars' Revenge.

Identity: Two-phase win — break a 5-block shield, then strike the
Qotile when it appears.
Win condition: break the shield AND hit Qotile.
Reward: Pattern B milestones, +0.1 per shield block destroyed (5 total
= +0.5), +0.5 on Qotile hit. Total = +1.0 on full win. -1.0 on death.

    Right-side wall: column 11 holds 5 shield blocks (B) at rows 3-7.
    Behind the shield, Qotile (Q) sits at column 13 row 5. The agent
    (Y, arrow facing right) starts at the left at row 5.

    Phase 1 (shield): FIRE shoots a bullet from your facing direction.
    Each block hit = +0.1. After all 5 are gone, the shield is open.
    Phase 2 (Qotile): with the shield gone, FIRE that hits Qotile gives
    +0.5 and wins. Qotile fires a destroyer beam: every 6 ticks, a beam
    (b) launches from Qotile traveling left 1 cell/tick along row 5.
    If the beam hits the player, -1 terminal.
