"""MiniGrid Unlock and UnlockPickup environments.

Unlock: Pick up key, unlock the door (terminates on TOGGLE-unlock).
UnlockPickup: Pick up key, unlock door, pick up the box behind it.

Reference Minigrid Unlock terminates on toggling the locked door open;
reference UnlockPickup terminates on picking up the target object.
We follow the reference — the previous implementation placed a Goal ★
inside the right room, which was visible THROUGH the wall and trivialised
the puzzle.
